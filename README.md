<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About Joseph Schoen

First and foremost, I love writing code! Ever since I was a kid, I gained interest in computers as my older brother was a software engineer. Since I was 12 I found great interest in building computers, messing with applications, and learning some code with my brother. I have always been intrigued in math and science, and I love figuring out the correct answer and teaching someone else who does not understand. Over three years while I was in college, it became clear to me that the computer science field was meant for me! I believe in the possibilities programming has to enhance this world, and in result improving lives!

As a former student at the University of St. Thomas, I am ready to be in the computer science field! I have come a long way from just using a computer, to understanding the mathematical processes that actually make it work. As I continue to grow in knowledge, I am intrigued to applying the knowledge I have, but also learn more about how to effectively code, problem solve, work on a team, develop plans, and much more! I am blessed to have found such a great interest in this field, and I want to use it!

Now, that leaves me with much yet to learn, but I am beyond excited to continue learning as I find joy every time I open my software's to start programming. I am grateful for this journey I have already had, and truly excited for the next steps!
